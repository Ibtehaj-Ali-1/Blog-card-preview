## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- I learned how to use flexbox to align elements in a row and column.
- I learned how to use the :hover and :focus pseudo-classes to change the appearance of different objects.

<!-- ```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
``` -->

### Continued development

- I would like to continue to learn more about flexbox and how to use it to create responsive layouts.
- I would also like to learn more about how to use pseudo-classes to create interactive elements.
